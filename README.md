## Installation

1. Open Phoenix Code
2. Go to Extension Manager
3. Search for "Quick Actions"

## How to use

After installation, the action bar appears automatically. Just click any button to perform that action.

Buttons will be disabled when their actions aren't available (like Undo when there's nothing to undo).

You can also toggle the visibility of the action bar using View menu > Toggle Action Bar.
